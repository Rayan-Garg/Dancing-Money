# <b>Smart Safe Box</b>

You can enter your password on the Serial Command Line, it will acknowledge that youâ€™ve entered a password, and then you can use the keypad to try different possible combinations for the password. If you get it wrong, an alarm sounds. But, if you get it right, the box opens, and money starts rotating. I built this as a fun project that combined laser cutting, programming, arduino chips, servo motors, and other hardware components.
