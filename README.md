# <b>Smart Safe Box</b>

You can enter your password on the Serial Command Line, it will acknowledge that you’ve entered a password, and then you can use the keypad to try different possible combinations for the password. If you get it wrong, an alarm sounds. But, if you get it right, the box opens, and money starts rotating. The serial command line also acknowledges that you’ve cracked the safe.
